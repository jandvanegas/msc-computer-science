## 8086 Introduction

Process of developing a programm

* Source (Text file, hll, .c)
* Compiler (Translate into .obj)
* .obj (does not depend on the language, it depends on the machine)
* Linker (.obj into .exe)
* Exec (.exe, machine language)

Process of running a programm

* Run p.exe
* OS
* Loader (moves .exe to the ram)

### Question: Without taking into account EULA (Licenced, C.C. License) that does not allow you to do Reverse Engineering. How far could do go from .exe to the source? -> impossible?

Variable at different levels:

* Source -> Name, Type
* Exec -> Cell of memory identified by an address

First Reason to say you cannot go from .exe to the source:

* The goal of the compiler is to match variables in source level to exec. Name -> Address
* If you want to go from Address to a variable in the source level, you would lose information like the type of the variable.

Second reason: Let's say we have a variable `a <- a + b + c + d + e` in source level. At exec level, this would have to be executed by parts like:

```asm6502
a <- a + b
a <- a + c
a <- a + d
a <- a + e
```

This means: one instruction at a high level can generate many instructions at the exec level. Therefore, going from low-level instructions it's not feasible, given that instructions at low-level could be rearranged because of optimization.

### Until which point can we go? From bottom to top

* Exe 100011000 (Machine level instructions). We can understand what is done when finding this instruction (e.g. add the content of reg #1 with reg #2 and store the result in #1)
* This understanding is **Assembly Language** e.g `ADD AX, BX` and this does not cost that much. The compiler can do this corresponding. **This is what we will learn**

### What is an instruction set?

* All the set of instructions that can be used to develop a program.
Each machine has different sets.

### 8086 Arch
* It is important to know the hw architecture of the hardware you use.
* Full control means full responsability.
* 16 bits architecture -> size of the registers.
* General purpose Registers A, B, C, D
    * AX -> 16 bits
    * AH, AL -> AH|AL
* Registers
  * Be used as pointers 
    * SI, DI, BP, (BX) -> 16 bits
  * Can be used as general and pointers, but do not used them 
directly.
    * SP -> Stack pointer
    * IP -> Instruction pointer. Program Counter (PC)
      * Notes 
      * Next (In time domain)
      * Following (in space domain)
  * Segment 16 bits
    * CS -> Code Segment
    * SS -> Stack Segment
    * DS -> Data Segment
    * ES -> Extra Segment
  * How to address 1M of instructions
    * How many cells can be addres with the IP? 
    * IP is 16 bits = 2^16 = 64K cells
    * But we need 20 bits 2^20 = 1M
    * However, we just need the Address bus to be 20 bits 
    * We need 4 bits more.
    * | 4 bits | IP |
    * This was solved overlapping with CS registers like:
    * | 0000 | 16 bits IP     | +  
      | 16 bits CS     | 0000 |

```

    * Bad indexing example: Assembler does not check if you bad index.
    If you want a carrot but you index 3. Assembler does not tell you
    that you're accessing a tomato. However if yo declare correctly
    the compiler would check. An even worst case is if you index 5 and
    you end up accessing code.

### Memory
```
|-----| 1230
|-----| 1231
|-----| 1232
|-----|  |
|-----|  Our convention increasing in this direction
|-----|
| 1 byte |
```

Let's say we want to move the content of AX (|AL|AH|) to the address 
1234 `MOV @ 1232, AX`, but we have then a mismatch
because 1232 address is just 8 byte long. However the compiler will
consider 1232 as the first cell to be involved. Therefore, two cell
actually would be involved. 
There are two ways to store the register 
Littler Endian (Lower at the lower address)
```
|AL| 1232
|AH| 1233
```
or 
Big Endian (Higher at the lower address)
|AH| 1232
|AL| 1233
### Stack -> LIFO
Last input, first output
```
_____
|   |<Stack Segment> <-SP = 0
|   |
|   |
|   |
|   |
|   |
| x | 
| x | 
| x |
| x | 
| x | <-SP The stack has two values
| x | 
| x | 
| x | 
-----
|   | <- SP when stack is empty
```
* Increase of the stack is opposite to the increase of address of memory
* SP(Stack pointer) -> points to the top of the stack
* Each element in an stack is 16 bits -> two cells
* No allowed pushing constants
* At the beginning when the stack is empty, SP is outside the Stack 
  segment and has value the size of the SS plus one
* When an item is added to the Stack, SP is reduced by two cells addres
  in the stack.
* When pushing to the stack `PUSH AX`, two things happen. `SUB SP, 2`
  and `MOV [SP] AX`.
* It is stored as little endian.
```
|    |
| AL | 
| AH | 
-----
```
* SP should not be negative because that would mean the stack was 
  overflowed.
* Choose mindfully the size of the SS(Stack segment). You have limited 
  area in 8086.

```
Addressing Modes
Register | Direct
Constant | Indirect
------------------
CPU      | Memory
```

```
MOV dest, source ; copy from source to destination
```
* Operations needing two operands:
  I cannot have two operands both in memory.
CPU
* Register -> Mov AX, BX
* Constant -> MOV AX, 7
(MOV 7, AX) -> Not valid

Memory
Direct
* MOV AX,  @7 ; at address 7 

Commands to compiler
JOHN DW 101 ; Reserve 16 bits in the data segment
              and store 101 in that address. JOHN will have the address
              of this space. Therefore, the developer can use this 
              variable to reference the reserved address.
Symbol Table
Used by the compiler, just on compilation. After that it is deleted.
Meaning it is not used at runtime.
NAME What?     Equivalence
JOHN Word Data  <address>

MOV AX, JOHN + 2 ; This will be replaced at compile time with
MOV AX, <address> + 2

Array definition
N EQU 35 ; Constant definition
JIM DB N DUP(?); DUP dupplication, N number of cells, ? random value.

* Indirect
```
MOV JIM[ ], 0; in the space, you can use BX, BP, SI, DI
MOV JIM[BX], 0 ; BX is a contribution to compute the final address of memory. 
```
1:35:19
In a loop it would be
```
MOV JIM[BX], 0

INC BX
```
* At compiler -> JIM is replaced with the real address
* At runtime the real address is sum up with BX, and that is the 
  destination where 0 is placed.

* Be careful using the next way of addressing:
```
MOV JIM[BX][SI], 0; BX or BP, SI or DI
;JIM[BX][SI] -> <JIM address> BX + SI -> this is the offset of 
; the data segment
; BP in the first square  accesses the stack segment
```
* The next operations are translated to different actions 
  because the operands are different. In the first case for 
  example the first is Register content to Register content,
  in the second constant to Register content.
```
BOB DW ?
MOV AX, BX ; Register to Register
MOV AX, 2 ; Constant to Register
MOV AX, BOB ; Content of the address to Register. BOB becomes hardcoded
MOV AX, [BX] ; Content of the Address BX has to Register
```
* Data transfer
```
MOV dest, source
MOV JOHN, JIM ; WRONG to have two memory cells
MOV JOHN, 0 ; OK 0 is not in memory. It is part of the instruction
```
* Challenge
```
XCHG AX, BX; Let say we want this to swap values.

;Not a good solution
MOV CX, AX
MOV AX, BX
MOV BX, CX

;A good solution
PUSH CX
MOV CX, AX
MOV AX, BX
MOV BX, CX
POP CX

;Another good solution, but slowest
PUSH AX
PUSH BX
POP AX
POP BX

;Another good solution
PUSH AX
MOV BX, AX
POP AX

;The fastest
XOR AX, BX
XOR BX, AX
XOR AX, BX
```
> Date: 06/10/2021
Explanation of:
```
XOR AX, BX
XOR BX, AX
XOR AX, BX

<AX> a
<BX> b

XOR AX, BX
b xor a
XOR BX, AX
((b xor a) xor b)
rearranging
( b xor b) xor a 
( FALSE ) xor a
a
a is stored in BX
XOR AX, BX
(a xor (b xor a))
reagganging
(a xor a) xor b
(FALSE) xor b
b
b is stored in AX
```

Other instructions
```
ROL -> ROL AX, 8 ; Rotate left
ROR -> ROR AX, 8 ; Rotate right
Allows me to swap AL AH

LEA -> Load effective address
It can be used just when the second opearand is an address
e.g.
ARR DB 10 DUP(?)
LEA BX, ARR; BX is loaded with the address of ARR

MOV BX, ARR; Copy the first cell on BX, (there is an error because of size)
MOV BX, OFFSET ARR; The same as LEA -> Constant addressing mode

Another example
LEA SI, ARR[BX]; Address of ARR plus the content of BX
However:
MOV SI, OFFSET ARR[BX] ; This is WRONG Content of BX is not available, 
                       ;and OFFSET needs a constant.

To have the same, we need two instructions:
MOV SI, OFFSEST ARR
ADD SI, BX
```
Other instructions
```
PUSHA POPA -> push all registers and pop all registers
```
Different types of binary representation
* UNSIGNED 
* 2's complement
* ~~module and sign~~
* ~~BCD~~
```
100 (4)
From unsigned to signed
First swap 0 to 1
100 -> 011 
Add 1 to the least significant bit
11 + 1 -> 100 (-4)
```
With 3 bits we go
* Unsigned from 0 to 7
* 2's complement from -4 to 3

Other instructions:
```
ADD
ADC -> Add with carry Operand1 + Operand2 + CF
SUB
SBB -> Substract with borrow Operand1 - Operand2 - CF
Example
Sum 32 bits Unsigned
AX BX +
|_| |_|
SI DI
|_| |_|
______
|_| |_|
CX DX

First Solution (Never overwrite input values)
MOV DX, BX
MOV CX, AX -> This could affect CF, so ALWAYS use flags inmediately after generated 
ADD DX, DI -> This could produce CF
ADC CX, SI

or

MOV DX, DI
MOV CX, SI -> This could affect CF, so ALWAYS use flags inmediately after generated 
ADD DX, BX -> This could produce CF
ADC CX, AX
```
### Overflow
Impossibility to represent a value givent the current number of bits.

#### Compute the average of grades obtained at our bachelor level course
```
Analysis
sum(ai)/N
18 < a < 31 -> can be represent by 5 bits
N = 16
sum(ai)/N -> worst case to represent would be 16 * 31 -> 496 -> 9 bits

Code:
scores db N dup(?) ; 8 bit
result dw ? ; 16 bits

average db ? ; 8 bits 
; because of scores being db and result dw, we have a data mismatch
; one option is to use AL
ADD AL, scores[bx]
ADC AH, 0
; other solution is to extend score[bx] sign, but be careful with CBW
CBW -> convert byte to word
* domain in 2's complement values
* it is extending the sign <AL> to <AH>
```
> date: 08/10/2022
Note: append 0 to numbers if conflict like next:
```
MOV AH, 0AH 
MOV AH, 0FFH
```
Example of overflow
```
Unsigned
0110 +
1001
----
1111 -> CF = 0, no overflow

1001 + 
1001
----
0010 -> CF = 1, overflow
Basically if CF is True, overflow has occur
```
```
2's complement
0101 +
0010
----
0111 CF=0, no overflow

0101 +
0101
----
1010 CF=0, overflow

1110
1111
----
1101 CF=1, no overflow
CF is not useful. For 2's, you can use OF (overflow flag) to check overflow
```
Continuing with sum of grades
```
for ai grades, we're not using 0 to 17 representations. we can simplify.
e.g. scatter matrixes are represented in a simpler way 
We can simplify taking out 18
bi = ai -18 ; this needs just 4 bits
sum(ai)/16 -> sum(bi+18)/16 -> (16*18 + sum(bi))/16 = 18 + sum(bi)16
```
Going back to instructions
```
INC CL -> ADD CL, 1
DEC AX -> SUB AX, 1
NEG BX -> BX will store -b
          Neg can be done with
            XOR AX, 0FFFFH
            INC AX
```
Declaring and accessing matrixes
```

|C|D| i=1
|E|F| i=2
|G|H| i=3

Example add data not in diagonal and take out the ones in the diagonal
```
|X|Y|Y|Y|
|Y|X|Y|Y|
|Y|Y|X|Y|

We substract Xs, whose index is 0,5,10,15
We have two options 
* All - 2 Xs 
* or Ys - Xs
```
Going back to instruction
```
Multiplication
MUL ;unsigned 
IMUL ; 2's complement

8x8
MUL CL ; implicit second operand AL, AX stores  AL * CL
16x16
MUL CX; implicit second operand AX, DX:AX stores AX * CX < 2^32 - 1

Overflow
We don't have it for sure in unsigned, on signed.

-8 ...+7 -> 4bits
critical case -8 * -8 + 64 -> 8 bits (7 for data, 1 for signed)
```
Another instruction
```
DIV ; unsigned
IDIV ; signed
Dividend / Divisor -> Quotient and Residual
DIV CL; CL divisor AX implicit dividend, AL stores quotient and AH residual
16 / 3
|Q | R|
|5 | 1| R should be smaller than D and non negative
No overflow on residual
However with 2's complement
-16/3 -> -5, -1, -6, 2 
16/-3 -> -5, +1, -6, -3
There are two convention
Residual is non negative
Residual has same sign as dividend
```
